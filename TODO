Flag transcripts with invalid CDS
Add new Properties (default Genome, default Fasta)
Add options to change reference (use version, set default version)
Standardize Exception hierarchy/handling
Fix Maven naming (SNPomics-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar?)
Add annotation Group support
Expand CLI properties support (delete properties?)
Register requested OutputFields with InteractiveAnnotations to allow optimizations? (eg, don't calculate protein effects if not needed)
If only one genome in db, select automatically
Use correct translation table for Alt chromosomes
Rollback database writes on failure
Add robust help system ('SNPomics help', 'SNPomics help list', etc)
Properly format the output of the various 'list' commands
Might not want to call close on System.out

Bugs:
Protein names when variant spans exon/intron junction (how to annotate?)
Protein names when duplicating insertions > 1bp on reverse strand
cDNA names - duplicating insertions
VCF output is invalid for p.(=) - can't have = in an INFO field

Annotations:
More detail on TranscriptEffects - Impact, position in gene (exon/intron/UTR), effect (syn/nonsyn/nonsense/etc)
dbSNP (how much detail?  Gets unwieldy)
Other MAF sources (ESP)
