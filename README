We've migrated to the Maven build system for two major reasons:
  1) It simplifies dependencies tremendously - no more storing jars in Git
  2) It simplifies the build-test-deploy lifecycle, and creates a jar-with-dependencies with one command

Even with these changes, it's still quite simple to develop in Eclipse.  Follow these steps to set up development:
  1) Install Maven (http://maven.apache.org/index.html).  This mainly involves setting a couple of environment variables
  2) From the SNPomics directory, run 'mvn compile'.  This will download all the dependencies needed for compilation
  3) Run 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' to generate the Eclipse .project and .classpath files
  4) In Eclipse, add the M2_REPO variable to the buildpath (Preferences/Java/Build Path/Classpath Variables).  It should be the path to your Maven repository (~/.m2/repository)
  5) Either close/reopen your existing project, or Import an Existing Project

More JDBC libs can be added to the dependencies section of pom.xml, they should have a scope of 'runtime'

To generate the final single jar file, run 'mvn package'
